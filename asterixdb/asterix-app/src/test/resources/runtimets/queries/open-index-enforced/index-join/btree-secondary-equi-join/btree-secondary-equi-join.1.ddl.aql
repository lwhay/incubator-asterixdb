/*
 * Description    : Equi joins two datasets, DBLP and CSX, based on their title.
 *                  DBLP has a secondary btree open enforced index on authors, and given the 'indexnl' hint
 *                  we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 * Success        : Yes
