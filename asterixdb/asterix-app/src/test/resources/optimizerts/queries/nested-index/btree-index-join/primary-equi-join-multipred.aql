/*
 * Description    : Equi joins two datasets, Customers and Orders, based on the customer id.
 *                  Given the 'indexnl' hint we expect the join to be transformed
 *                  into an indexed nested-loop join using Customers' primary index.
 *                  We expect the additional predicates to be put into a select above the
 *                  primary index search.
 * Success        : Yes
